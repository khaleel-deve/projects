            <h3>Our curriculum focuses on the holistic development of the child and is suitably
                mapped to age-appropriate objectives and outcomes. Based on Dr. Howard
                Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Experiential Learning, the
                KLAY curriculum empowers the child to be able to establish a routine, follow
                directions, make friends and work independently.
